# tic-tac-toe
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3Ã—3 grid. Players take turns marking X or O in empty squares. The first to align three symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins. If all squares are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw. Simple, strategic, and fun.
